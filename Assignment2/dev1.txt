Business Opportunity or Problem

1.	Describe the business opportunity or problem(s) this project addressed and how it related to the 
(internal or external) clientâ€™s needs. 

JPMC had various Lines of Businesses, which were separate entities within the organisation, 
Ex: Investment Banking, Equity Research, IT Risk and Security Management, etc.

Since the LoBs were separate entities, high risk LoBs (Ex: Research) wanted to monitor sharing of documents though email
(either intentionally or by accident) with other low risk LoBs and block high confidentiality documents, 
if they were being shared. JPMC's IT Risk and Security Management wanted to install Symantec Data Loss Prevention tool on
their email servers to do this. The DLP server would be configured block all attachments in emails going out to email ids in other LoBs and 
above certain threshold of confidentiality levels. 

As part of this initiative, JPMC needed a way of tagging the documents with 
information about what LoB it is from and confidentiality level of the document.

This tagging of documents was called 'watermarking' and is not related to the physical watermarking of documents.

TCS was selected to come up with a solution where a user can upload a document to the watermarking server,
get it watermarked, download it and then use it to share via email. The document could be any one of 
a. MS Office documents 97-2003 versions to latest 2010 version, XPS documents
b. PDF
c. Audio/Video files - MP3, MP4, MPEG, etc.
d. Image files - JPG, PNG, etc.


This was implemented by us by providing a web site  front-end developed in C#.NET and the 
watermarking server in the back-end developed in Perl.


2.	Describe the scope and complexity of the problem. 

Scope:
a. All the document types should be watermarked
b. The solution should be available at least 24x5 for JPMC employees all over the world.

3.	Describe your relationship and communications with client management / user management / end users.
