Business Opportunity or Problem

1.	Describe the business opportunity or problem(s) this project addressed and how it related to the (internal or external) clientâ€™s needs. 

JPMC's IT Risk and Security Management wanted to install Symantec Data Loss Prevention tool on their email servers.

JPMC had various Lines of Businesses, which were separate entities within the organisation, 
Ex: Investment Banking, Equity Research, IT Risk and Security Management, etc.

Since the LoBs were separate entities, high risk LoBs (Ex: Research) wanted to monitor sharing of documents though email
(either intentionally or by accident) with other low risk LoBs and block high confidentiality documents, 
if they were being shared.
The DLP server would block all attachments in emails going out to email ids in other LoBs, unless it was 'watermarked', i.e., 
unless the document tagged with some information about the confidentiality level of the document.
